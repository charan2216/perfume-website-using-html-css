            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Perfume is a fragrant liquid typically made from a mixture of essential oils, aroma compounds, and solvents. It is used primarily for its pleasant scent and is applied to the skin or clothing to enhance personal fragrance. Perfumes come in a wide variety of scents and concentrations, ranging from light and subtle eau de toilette to more concentrated and long-lasting eau de parfum. They have been used for centuries for personal grooming, rituals, and as a form of self-expression. Perfume can evoke emotions, memories, and create a unique sensory experience for both the wearer and those around them.</p>
